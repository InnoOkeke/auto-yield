# AutoYield Impact & Audiece

## 🌍 How will your solution make a difference?

AutoYield bridges the massive gap between **"Access"** and **"Action."**

Today, anyone *can* access DeFi, but very few *do* because the barriers are functionally too high. By removing the friction of gas fees, daily transactions, and complex interfaces, we are effectively **democratizing wealth creation.**

We aren't just saving users time; we are changing user behavior.
*   **Before:** Users hoard USDC because earning yield is "too much work."
*   **After:** Users become active participants in the DeFi economy effortlessly.

This shift from "Active Management" to "Passive Accumulation" is the key difference. We are turning Farcaster from a place where you *talk* about money into a place where you *grow* it.

## 👥 Who will benefit from your solution?

### 1. The "Crypto Curious" (Newcomers)
These are people who own some USDC or ETH but are terrified of using complex dApps. They want the 10% yields they hear about but don't know how to bridge, swap, or stake.
*   **Benefit:** They get a simple "Save" button that works like a fintech app they already understand.

### 2. The Busy Native (Power Users)
Even crypto natives forget to compound their rewards.
*   **Benefit:** They save mental energy. They can allocate 10% of their stack to AutoYield and know it’s being optimized perfectly without them lifting a finger.

### 3. High-Inflation Regions (Global South)
For users in countries with 50%+ inflation, earning stable USD yield is a lifeline. However, gas fees often eat up almost all their potential earnings on small deposits ($10-$50).
*   **Benefit:** Because our Relayer pays the gas, these users can finally save purely for profit, without being priced out by network fees.

## 🛑 What problems will it solve?

1.  **The "Gas Tax" on Saving:** Traditional DeFi punishes small savers. If you deposit $10 and pay $1 in gas, you're down 10% immediately. AutoYield eliminates this, making micro-savings viable.
2.  **Cognitive Overload:** There are too many protocols. AutoYield simplifies the choice: "Just deposit here, we handle the routing."
3.  **User Inertia:** Humans are bad at daily habits. We automate the habit so willpower isn't required.

## 🚀 What opportunities will it create?

### "Social DeFi"
By embedding savings into a social feed (Farcaster), we create opportunities for:
*   **Community Savings Goals:** "Let's all save for a trip to DevCon together."
*   **Yield Sharing:** A creator could set their AutoYield to automatically route 1% of their yield to donate to a public good or funding pool.

### The "Savings-as-a-Service" Layer
The backend infrastructure we built (relayers, cron jobs, AI agents) can be whitelabeled. Other wallets or Frame developers could plug into our **"AutoYield Engine"** to offer automated savings features to their own users instantly.
